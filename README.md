Story
In my data-driven world, Sales_Raw_Data and Promotion Data are the heroes of my Power BI dashboard. Data Explorer meticulously 
compiles raw sales figures, while PromoMaster tracks the success of marketing efforts. Together, they create a dynamic dashboard that 
reveals real-time insights into sales performance and the effectiveness of promotions. Armed with this information,
I make informed decisions to drive my personal success in the competitive landscape of data analysis.
